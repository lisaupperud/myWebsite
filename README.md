This project is a responsive and accessible HTML website built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It follows semantic HTML structure and applies consistent color schemes with sufficient contrast for better readability. 
The site features a shared header, navigation bar, and footer across all pages, with the main content organized using main, section, and article elements.

Key features include:

    A responsive design with image elements using srcset for optimal display on different devices.

    A mobile-friendly hamburger menu implemented with JavaScript.

    A CV page showcasing work experience, education, and skills, styled with Flexbox.

    A “Technology” page with a JavaScript-powered filter function that allows users to search and display articles based on selected keywords via a dropdown menu.

All code is validated through online tools to ensure proper structure and functionality. 
This project demonstrates core front-end development principles with a focus on accessibility, maintainability, and user experience.
