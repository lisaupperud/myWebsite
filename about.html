                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Lisa Upperud from Stockholm, Sweden! I'm a first year student enrolled in the Java Developer Program at Stockholms
                    Tekniska Institut. At age 24 I discovered my interest for programming through a C# course. I have
                    always been a very
                    structured and organized person which translated well with programming and a new hobby was born.
                    I've always been very creative and found that programming was a great creative outlet for me. I
                    applied to STI in spring of 2024 and later enrolled in september that same year. Since the start of my
                    education I've been seeing the world through different eyes. I constantly see
                    ways to improve the world around me, which I think is the most exciting
                    about writing code. The possibilities for improvement seem endless</p>

                <h2>My Interests</h2>
                <p>Aside from my studies and part time job at Lemon Bar, I enjoy spending time with my friends and
                    family, cooking, painting, strength training and spending time is nature, especially the Swedish
                    woods. A favorite interest of mine is reading, something
                    I've been doing since I was 2 and a half years
                    old. Aside from the occational thriller, I really enjoy
                    non-fiction books, mainly about neuro-science, health and biology. My favorite authors and educators
                    include Andrew Huberman, Anders Hansen and Robert Sapolsky. I find that learing about the human mind
                    and
                    body is crucial to our well-being as people and constatly learining about the science behind the human race
                    helps keep me motivated to life a healthy and productive life.</p>
