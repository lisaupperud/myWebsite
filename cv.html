                <p><strong>Description: </strong>During my years at Lokal Izakaya and Lemon Bar I have taken responsibility for
                    tasks such as opening and
                    closing
                    procedures, ensuring that drinks, garnishes, napkins, and other supplies are well-stocked to

                    seamless
                    service.
                    Cleanliness and organization have always been priorities, ensuring a fresh and inviting environment
                    throughout
                    each shift. I have also contributed to creating seasonal drink menus, showcasing innovative

                <p><strong>Description: </strong>Working in dynamic and fast-paced environments has helped me develop
                    strong communication skills, enabling effective collaboration within teams. I've honed my
                    problem-solving abilities by navigating conflicts and challenges, always maintaining
                    professionalism. Adaptability has become second nature, as each day brings unique situations
                    requiring quick adjustments and a focus on optimal performance. Serving over 300 guests daily has
                    given me extensive experience in creating positive customer experiences, ensuring satisfaction for
                    diverse individuals. Additionally, managing stress in high-pressure settings has taught me to stay
                    composed and deliver exceptional results, even when juggling multiple demands.</p>
